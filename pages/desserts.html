            <h2>Apple Pie (Serves 12)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="ingre_a">
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>14 Very Heaped Tablespoons of Self Raising Flour</li>
                <li>150g of Butter</li>
                <li>4 tbsp of Granulated Sugar</li>
                <li>1 Large Egg mixed with 180ml of Milk</li>
                <li>4-5 Bramley Cooking Apples</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Method:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C.</li>
                <li>Now put flour, sugar and butter into a large bowl and rub the mix until it looks like breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>Make a hole in the mix and add the egg and milk.</li>
                <li>Cut the mix with a knife and keep going with it until it forms a dough. (Add a little more milk if you need to).</li>
                <li>Knead the dough for a couple of minutes. Cut it in half, put one half to one side. Knead the first half again and roll it out with a rolling pin.</li>
                <li>Dust a dinner plate with some flour first then put your rolled out dough onto the plate and trim the edge. Put to one side, knead and roll out the second half as this will be your top.</li>
                <li>Peel your apples, chop them up into fairly large chunks and be careful not to get any skin, seeds or core in it. Put into a medium pot, add 4 tablespoons of granulated sugar and a little bit of water (120ml) and stew the apples. (It takes a high heat and stirring constantly until they are stewed).</li>
                <li>Put the stewed apple onto your prepared plate then put your rolled out second half of dough on top and trim around the edge to take the excess dough away.</li>
                <li>Put 4 slit holes in the top with a knife in the middle on the top of the pie. Seal the edges with a fork. (This is less sticky if you dip your fork into some flour in between otherwise the dough will stick to the fork a lot).</li>
                <li>Sprinkle sugar on the top and put in the oven on the middle shelf for around 20-25 minutes until golden brown.</li>
                <li>Best served hot with cream or ice cream.</li>

            <h2>Strawberry Cheese Cake (Serves 12)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="ingre_b">
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>250g of Digestive Biscuits</li>
                <li>100g of Butter, Melted</li>
                <li>1 Vanilla Pod</li>
                <li>600g Full Fat Soft Cheese</li>
                <li>100g of Icing Sugar</li>
                <li>284ml of Double Cream</li>
                <li>400g of Strawberries, Halved</li>
                <li>25g of Icing Sugar</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Method:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>For the base, butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment. Crush the digestive biscuits to crumbs with a rolling pin. Transfer the crumbs to a bol, and pour over the melted butter. Mix thoroughly.</li>
                <li>Tip the breadcrumb/butter mix into the tin and press firmly to create an even layer. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour to set firmly.</li>
                <li>Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds using the back of a kitchen knife.</li>
                <li>Pour the double cream into a bowl and whisk with an electric mixer until it begins to thicken to soft peaks. Place the soft cheese, 100g of icing sugar and vanilla seeds in a separate bowl and beat for 2 minutes with an electric mixer until smooth and starting to thicken.</li>
                <li>Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix, ensuring it is thick enough to hold its shape when you tip a spoon of it upside down. If it’s not thick enough, continue to whisk.</li>
                <li>Spoon mix onto the biscuit base, making sure there are no air bubbles. Smooth the top of the cheesecake down with the back of a spatula and leave to set in the fridge overnight.</li>
                <li>For the topping, puree half of the strawberries with 25g of icing sugar and 1 tsp of water, then sieve. Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake and pour the puree over the top.</li>

            <h2>Chocolate Cake (Serves 12)</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="ingre_c">
            <p>Ingredients:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>175g of Softened Butter</li>
                <li>175g of Caster Sugar</li>
                <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
                <li>150g of Self-Raising Flour, Sifted</li>
                <li>50g of Cocoa, Sifted</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Baking Powder</li>
                <li>1 tsp of Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
                <p>For Simple Chocolate Icing:</p>
                <li>100g of Dark Chocolate</li>
                <li>100g of Chopped Butter</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Method:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180°C. Lightly grease an 18cm round cake tin with a little extra butter and cut a piece of greaseproof paper or non-stick baking parchment to fit the base of the tin.</li>
                <li>Put all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon or a hand-held mixer for 1 minute, or until just combined. It's important not to beat the batter too much - just long enough to make it smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour or spoon the mixture into the tin, smooth the top and bake on the middle shelf of the oven for about 45-50 minutes. The cake is cooked when it looks well risen and golden; the top should spring back when lightly touched with a fingertip. Another test is to insert a skewer into the centre of the cake - it should come out clean.</li>
                <li>Let the cake sit in the tin for 5 minutes, then gently run a knife around the edge and turn the cake out onto a wire rack to cool.</li>
                <li>For the icing, place the dark chocolate and chopped butter in a heatproof bowl and set over a saucepan of very hot water until melted. Cool for 15 minutes, then spread over the top of the cooled cake.</li>
                <li>Best served hot with cream or ice cream.</li>
            </ol>
